# RomanConversion
application that converts numbers into roman literals

This application is used to convert an integer to  its equivalent roman string literal and vice versa.
As part of the api we have developed two get api which will consume input in the format of String and Integer 
and give us response Integer and String respectively.
Point to note that we have not included any non negative numbers as there is no negative roman literals are present 
and we have made an exception will be thrown when passing negative numbers
